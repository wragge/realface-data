# The Real Face of White Australia: Data

This repository includes data generated through the [Real Face of White Australia](http://transcribe.realfaceofwhiteaustralia.net/) project, which is transcribing records from the National Archives of Australia.

## CSV files

The [data/csv](data/csv/) directory contains transcribed data in CSV format. These are fields that have been marked by the transcription system as 'complete' -- that is, they have been transcribed by a number of volunteers and any differences have been reconciled through the verification process. There are separate files for each type of document:

* Certificate of Domicile
* Certificate Exempting from Dictation Test

## Cropped images

Details of portrait photographs, handprints, thumbprints, and Chinese characters identified through the transcription process are included in the [data/csv](data/csv/) directory. For easy browsing, the cropped images are available on Dropbox:

* [Photos](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/isznt1z4w1hoqhe/AABW2T2mkdsAj57fjje4xjR5a?dl=0)
* [Hand and thumb prints](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5nvv49pvayvkt8s/AADCZ0x6jTrqdhbdF8tZVpowa?dl=0)
